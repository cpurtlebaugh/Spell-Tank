# SPELL TANK

## WHAT IS IT?
Spell Tank is a fun, spin-off of the classic game Hangman. This time our stickfigure
hero meets his demise in a tank of water. Oh what a fate! With each wrong guess,
you render the man one div closer to his demise. With only 6 chances to chose
a letter incorrectly, you better be ready to guess wisely against this 2D
array of topics and words.
